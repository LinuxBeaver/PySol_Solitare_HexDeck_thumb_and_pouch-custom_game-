# PySol-HexDeck-Game-Plugin
PySol Solitare Game plugins


To install you put the files in /home/USERNAME/.PySolFC/plugins and restart pysol. Then look for `T & P Hex Deck` and `Thumb and Pouch Plus 16` Hex Deck Cards.
You will find said two games that function like "Thumb and Pouch" and "China Man" Klondike solitare games.

Credit goes to all original authors of the original Hex Dexk games and PySol. All I did was change a few lines of code to get this modification.
